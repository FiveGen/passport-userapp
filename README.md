# Passport-UserApp

Password authentication strategy using [UserApp](https://www.userapp.io) for [Passport](http://passportjs.org/).

*UserApp is a cloud-based user management API for web apps with the purpose to relieve developers from having to program logic for user authentication, sign-up, invoicing, feature/property/permission management, and more.*

This module lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node.js
applications. By plugging into Passport, UserApp authentication can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-userapp

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The userapp authentication strategy authenticates users using a username and
password via a REST call to UserApp. The strategy requires a `verify` callback, which accepts these
credentials and calls `done` providing a user. To be able to use this strategy, you need a [UserApp account](https://app.userapp.io/#/sign-up/), with an [App Id](https://help.userapp.io/customer/portal/articles/1322336-how-do-i-find-my-app-id-).

    passport.use(new UserAppStrategy({
            appId: 'YOU-USERAPP-APP-ID'
        },
        function (userprofile, done) {
            Users.findOrCreate(userprofile, function(err,user) {
                if(err) return done(err);
                return done(null, user);
            });
        }
    ));

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'userapp'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.post('/login', 
      passport.authenticate('userapp', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        res.redirect('/');
      });

#### User Profile

The user profile follows the [Passport Profile Schema](http://passportjs.org/guide/profile/) when available. Some fields are added to contain all information from the [UserApp User entity](https://app.userapp.io/#/docs/user/#properties).

    { 
        provider: 'userapp',
        id: 'user_id',
        username: 'login',
        name: { familyName: 'last_name', givenName: 'first_name' },
        email: 'email',
        emails: [ { value: 'email' } ],
        permissions: { permissionName: { value: boolean, override: boolean } },
        features: { featureName: { value: boolean, override: boolean } },
        properties: { propertyName: { value: mixed, override: boolean } },
        subscription: { price_list_id: 'string', plan_id: 'string', override: boolean },
        lastLoginAt: unix_timestamp,
        updatedAt: unix_timestamp,
        createdAt: unix_timestamp,
        _raw: { /* raw UserApp User profile */ }
    }
    
Please note that when working with the [UserApp API](https://app.userapp.io/#/docs/), you will need to create a new user object according to the [User entity](https://app.userapp.io/#/docs/user/#properties). For example `username` => `login`.
